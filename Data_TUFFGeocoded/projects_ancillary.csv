La funcionaria explicó a periodistas que el crédito por 60 millones de dólares será destinado a financiar un proyecto de adquisiciones de perforadoras para el sector petrolero del país. 'Hemos detallado al plenario de Diputados que el crédito tiene por objeto acelerar las tareas de desarrollo de exploración de pozos para Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos' (YPFB), afirmó Caro. Un informe a la Asamblea legislativa explicó que la estatal YPFB solicitó una modificación al contrato con la empresa y en lugar de adquirir los kits de instalación doméstica, se prefirió la adquisición de los equipos perforadores. Caro dijo que mediante el crédito 'estamos usando el mismo monto de recursos para la adquisición de las perforadoras' y se han hecho todas las modificaciones correspondientes para concluir un trámite que ha sido extenso. La iniciativa aprobada abroga la Ley 4149 de 31 de diciembre de 2009 que aprobaba un crédito con EXIMBANK por el mismo monto para la adquisición de kits de instalación de gas doméstico. Añade que para YPFB es fundamental contar con los recursos para la compra de maquinaria debido a que en los últimos meses se han detectado pozos con grandes cantidades de hidrocarburos en diferentes partes del país, lo que hace necesaria la maquinaria para facilitar el trabajo de exploración de nuevas áreas. YPFB será la entidad ejecutora del proyecto y también será la empresa responsable del repago del financiamiento en las mismas condiciones establecidas en el convenio de préstamo. Según la ministra Caro, con el equipo que se adquirirá mediante el crédito YPFB podrá realizar los trabajos a partir del 2012 y hasta el 2020. Los equipos incluyen tres perforadoras, una de ellas valuada en 22,8 millones de dólares de 2.000 hp, la segunda de 1.500 hp y de 18,8 millones de dólares y la tercera de 1.000 hp con un precio de 18,3 millones de dólares, según el Ministerio de Planificación del Desarrollo. Caro explicó que la concesión del crédito es de 24 por ciento, a 25 años, cinco de gracia y 20 de amortización. El pleno de la Cámara de Diputados también aprobó el martes el proyecto de ley que ratifica el convenio de cooperación económica entre el Estado boliviano y el gobierno de China, suscrito el 12 de agosto de 2011 en la ciudad de Shenzhen.(Xinhua) People’s Daily Online Co., Ltd.

State company prepares tender for integrated drilling services as part of drive to address problem of country's declining reserves Bolivia's YPFB is preparing a tender for integrated drilling services as part of an effort to drill 60 exploration wells by 2015, according to the company's president Carlos Villegas. The state company intends to launch the tender within three months to boost drilling capacity.. YPFB has already contracted three 2000-horsepower rigs from China's SJ Petroleum Machinery, which are expected to start arriving in late 2012 at a cost of $19 million each, including transport.. YPFB is keen to address the problem of declining reserves since the introduction of nationalisation laws in 2006 caused a downturn in exploration. Companies such as Petrobras and Repsol YPF have maintained their investment at required levels since being demoted to junior partners in YPFB-controlled gas-producing projects such as San Alberto and Margarita, but wildcatting has dwindled. Over the past two years YPFB has made slow progress in finalising the terms of proposed new exploration and production contracts with private partners, using new laws offering 49% minority stakes in mixed companies. YPFB recently made some concessions on the terms on offer, and has also launched a 2012 licensing round, including 10 gas-prospective blocks and five oil-prospective areas in the Madre de Dios, Beni, southern sub-Andean, Andean foothills and Altiplano basins.. Villegas said YPFB has conceded additional guarantees for the recovery of 100% of the exploration investments borne by the private partner, should commerciality be declared.. Other new elements include the use of a US inflation index to govern the recovery of costs over a six-year period, and allowing the private partner joint responsibilities in managing the mixed company. . In the other form of contract, the private company operates throughout, and mixed company partner YPFB is carried through the life of the production contract. Pricing to industrial consumers will be formatted as averages between those governing current supply contracts to Brazil and Argentina, standing at $9.40 and $10.30 per million British Thermal Units respectively. YPFB will offer two forms of contract for new associations with private partners.. The risk form of service contract will allow the private companies to recover their exploration investments during the production phase, switching from a single to joint operatorship.. This was the model chosen by Gazprom and Total in negotiations for a new contract on the highly-rated Azero block. This contract is scheduled for board approval at both companies, Villegas said. Progress is being made with Repsol's YPF unit, for the Yuchan permit, with PetroVietnam, on Isipote and also on contracts with Petrobras and Pluspetrol. Exploration success on blocks in the licensing round can lead to the formation of a YPFB-controlled mixed company and a 30-year production concession. Villegas said he expected the licensing round to generate about 30 exploration wells in a first wave of drilling, with an estimated 30% success rate. YPFB's activity on the market for rigs and integrated services also follows from a decision to assign 15 exploration permits to the company's own subsidiaries, either alone or jointly. These contracts are expected to be signed soon. . The integrated service contracts to be offered by Bolivia will be similar in format to those awarded by Petroecuador in Ecuador recently.. The Schlumberger-led consortium that won that contract is starting work with in-country rigs this year and plans to bring up to three new units to Ecuador next year. Under YPFB's contract for three new rigs from SJ Petroleum Machinery about 210 Bolivians are being sent to China for training. Arduous consultation processes remain a major deterrent to investors in Bolivia, but Villegas said he was confident that new legislation under debate will incorporate proposals for a streamlined process.

Tras recordar los viejos tiempos revolucionarios del maoísmo, Morales también elogió el actual crecimiento económico de la potencia asiática, 'esos grandes trabajos que realiza no solamente en beneficio de China, sino también para el mundo'. También expresó 'respeto y felicitación' por la 'conquista del espacio' que lleva a cabo el gigante asiático, país que la semana pasada logró su primer aterrizaje controlado en la Luna -con una nave no tripulada- y en la madrugada del sábado lanzará el primer satélite boliviano, el 'Tupac Katari'.

The loan with an annual 3 per cent interest rate is to be repaid in 12 years, including a four-year grace period. The Cambodian government would lend this money to a Chinese-Cambodian joint venture, Kampuchea-Chinese International Cooperation Co Ltd, which is behind the project to build a factory producing plywood from rubber trees and scraps in Chup and Memot plantations, Kompong Cham Province (See Project ID#32071 for the follow-up of this agreement) STAFF_NOTE: Unsure regarding the kind of product that will be produced by the factory. While the Cambodian newspaper `Reaksmei Kampuchea' reported that the factory will produce plywood , Xinhua News Agency reported that the factory will produce Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) (recorded in Project ID#32071). Although both plywood and MDF are made of the same material (rubber wood), they are of different density, hence different kind of material. It may be a reporting error on the part of either one of the publisher or the factory would be producing both plywood and MDF. Despite this issue, I am confident that this project (ID#32016) and Project ID#32071 are referring to the same event.

"32077","2003","FALSE","China granted Cambodia an interest-free loan of 24 million USD to rebuild a 200 km long road from Kratie province to Trapeang Kriel, Stung Treng which is at the Cambodia-Laos border ( last segment of National Road No.7). The loan agreement was signed between Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Ning Fukui and the Cambodian government on November 27, 2003 in Phnom Penh. The interest-free loan agreement was one of two agreements signed during the ceremony; under the other agreement, China would provide a grant of US$6.1 million dollar to Cambodia, which would then be handed over to the Cambodian Foreign Ministry for general use by the Cambodian government (See Project ID#32081). The rebuilding project was undertaken by Shanghai Construction Group General Co. The project began on October 2004 and was completed on 31 Dec 2007. An Inauguration for the opening of the road was held on April 29, 2008. The interest-free loan is not the only recorded financial assistance provided by the Chinese government the project. In November 2002, China had provided a concessional loan with a 2% interest rate of US$60,980,000. On the same date, China had also provided US$2,430,000 in grant for the project (based on the 2 CDC reports found in the resource section below). The CDC reports are supported by a speech made by Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen, during his visit to the construction sites of National Road 7 in 26 July 2006; the PM has mentioned three types of assistance by China for the project- grant, non-interest loan and low-interest loan. On another note, the 2009 'Overview on Transport Infrastructure Sectors in the Kingdom of Cambodia' report published by the Infrastructure and Regional Integration Technical Working Group (IRITWG) has recorded that the total cost of the rehabilitation project for National Road 7 is around US$62.8 million dollars and was financed by China. STAFF_NOTE: Unsure if the US$24 million interest-free loan was provided by the Chinese government in addition to the US$60.98 million in loan and US$2.43 million in grant, or that the Chinese government has converted US$24 million out of the US$60.98 concessional loan into interest-free loan. Based on the 2009 IRITWG report which has recorded the total cost of the project as US$62.8 million dollars, the latter scenario is more probable.

The concessional loan is part of an agreement signed on 22 January 2007, under which China would provide 207 million US dollars of loans to Cambodia to develop its infrastructure construction (See Project ID#32113 for more details on the signed agreement). The estimated construction period was 40 months. The contractor for the project was Shanghai Construction Group General Co. while the consultant was Guangzhou Wanan Construction Supervision Co, Ltd. Based on the MPWT report (found in the resource section), the road was completed on July 2011. The inauguration ceremony for the official use of National Road No. 8 was held on 22 November 2012. The ceremony was attended by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Pan Guangxue, as well as senior government officials, foreign diplomats, about 5,000 residents and students.

On Poan Monirath and the Chairman of EXIM Bank of China, Mr Li Ruogu, signed a Preferential Buyer's Credit Loan Agreement. Under the agreement, EXIM bank agrees to provide a concessional loan of US$31,014,469 for an irrigation project in Kampong Trabek, Prey Veng Province. The loan agreement for the project is one out of 14 agreements signed between China and Cambodia on 21 December 2009; the total value of the agreements was widely believed to be US$853 million (See Project ID#32201). While the development of an irrigation system is one of the objective, the project is more known to be a flood control project in response to Kampong Trabek being susceptible to flood damage. Based on a report by Mekong River Commission (MRC), the flood risk has been estimated at US$0.7 million per year. The goal of the project is to improve flood control standard and to upgrade land utilization rate, cultivation condition and grain output and to build flood control dyke on both banks of Preaek Tra Beak river together with field irrigation and drainage system so as to provide irrigation water source and ensure drainage capability. Based on the CDC report, the project will include the building of flood control dyke on both banks of Preaek Trabek river (aka Kampong Trabek River or Stung Trabek) together with an irrigation canal and drainage canal network so as to provide irrigation water source for crops and ensure drainage capability to prevent flood damage. This corroborates with the MRC report, which has mentioned similar flood control mechanism with much more details and has reported that once the proposed flood control mechanism have been installed, the villagers can expect about 5 crops per year and net benefits from paddy of US$3.45 million/year According to Mekong Institute, the project was completed on March 24, 2014.

"36548","2011","TRUE","Summary: In February of 2011 it was announced that China proposed to build a railway linking the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Colombia as an alternative to the Panama Canal. It appears that there are two railway projects that are constantly being discussed. The first project is the 7.6 billion USD project to build a 791km railway from the interior of the country to the Pacific coast, along with an expansion of the port at Buenaventura. The purpose is to bring coal in from the interior to be shipped to China. The second is a more publicized yet vague project to build a 220km railway to connect the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, terminating in new cities purpose-built for this project. The intent is to bring Chinese products into the Pacific port, have them transported to the Atlantic port where they will be assembled and distributed, with raw materials being sent back to China in the return trip. The project to build a railway to Buenaventura is reported to be financed by China Development Bank. No other information on the flow type. Both projects are still being discussed and planned as of January 2014. STAFF_NOTE: It's only one project.

"450","2007","FALSE","On September 17, 2007, China and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed an agreement for a 9 billion USD loan deal from the Exim Bank of China. However, the loan was reduced to 6 billion USD in October 2009 because the IMF expressed concerns over the DRC�s national debt. The loan was meant to improve Congolese infrastructure and to develop mines in the Mashamba basin, the Dima basin, the Dik Colline D syncline, and Kolwezi. In return, the Congolese state copper company G�camines would concede a number of deposits containing up to 10.6 million tonnes of copper, of which approximately 6.8 million tonnes were confirmed. G�camines also promised between 425,000 and 625,000 tonnes of cobalt and access to all other potential mineral substances. The loan�s infrastructure component totaled 3 billion USD at a 4.4% interest rate. Sicomines Mining Joint Venture�s loan for developing mines includes a 2.13 billion USD loan at 6.1% interest and a 1.07 billion USD loan at 0% interest. Although the project was originally owned by Sinohydro Corporation (25% share), China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) (43% share), and G�camines (32% share), the CREC�s investment is currently resting on an appeal to the China's National People's Congress Standing Committee. As of May 2013, Chinese enterprises owned 62%, and the rest belonged to G�camines. The Congolese Infrastructure Minister Pierre Lumbi reported that 3 billion USD will be spent on infrastructure, including 2,000 miles of railway between Sakania and Matadi, a 2,000-mile road linking Kisanganiand and Kasumbalesa, a motorway between Lubumbashi and Kasumbalesa, 31 hospitals, 145 health centers, two international-standard universities, and 5,000 government housing units. The motorway between Lubumbashi and Kasumbalesa was constructed by the CREC between March and November 2008, totaling 72 km of road. The transportation projects were planned to be completed within 36 months. As of March 2013, 458 million USD have been released for infrastructure projects, and 540 million USD have been disbursed toward the mining operation. Of the 540 million USD, 350 million USD were used for a signing bonus, the rest for feasibility studies. The initial deal promised to provide China with copper and cobalt over the next 25 years. There are reportedly a total of 13 infrastructure projects implemented with the 458 million USD disbursed under the Sicomines agreement between 2008 and 2012: 1. Refurbishment of 5.3 km of Boulevard du 30 juin, Kinshasa. Status: completed. Cost: 24.1 million USD. 2. Refurbishment of 2.5 km of Boulevard du 30 juin, Kinshasa. Status: completed. Cost: 19.3 million USD. 3. Refurbishment of Esplanade of the People's Palace, Kinshasa. Status: completed. Cost: 19.7 million USD. 4. Refurbishment of 7.25 km of Avenue du Tourisme, Kinshasa. Status: completed. Cost: 24.3 million USD. 5. Refurbishment of 4.3 km of Boulevards Triomphale et Sendwe, Kinshasa. Status: completed. Cost 29.2 million USD. 6. Construction of a 450 bed hospital, Kinshasa. Status: completed. Cost: 99.9 million USD. 7. Refurbishment of Lutendele road, Kinshasa. Status: implementation. Cost: $21 million. 8. Refurbishment of 66 km of Beni-Luna road, North Kivu. Status: completed. Cost: 57.8 million USD. 9. Grading of 137 km of national road between Lubumbashi and Kasomeno, Katanga province. Status: completed. Cost: 50.5 million USD. 10. Asphalting of national road between Lubumbashi and Kasomeno, Katanga province. Status: implementation. Cost: 87.5 million USD. 11. Donation of solar panels by Sinohydro. Status: completed. Cost: 11 million USD. 12. Donation of generators. Status: implementation. Cost: 6.5 million USD. 13. Factory to build prefabricated houses, Kisangani. Status: implementation. Cost: 7.5 million USD. The loan�s ODA-like nature is disputed. Deborah Brautigam argues that despite changes to Exim Bank's variable interest rate of the above-mentioned loan, the deal should still not be counted as ODA. Johanna Janson argued that because the interest rate of Exim Bank's loan fell from 6.6% to 4.4% in a 2009 revised loan agreement, the deal should be labeled as ODA as the IMF- and OECD-calculated grant elements would rise to at least 42%. This fluctuation in the interest rate was included in the deal signed between the consortium of companies, not the Exim Bank. The initial interest rate was set at set at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Chinese companies are responsible for paying the difference between the 6.6% and 4.4% interest rates. By May 29, 2013, more than $1 billion had been disbursed for spending on various infrastructure projects including the Busanga hydroelectric project. According to Mo�se Ekanga, Congo's coordinator for the Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement, the company is due to launch production at the mine in 2015 under a renewable 25-year production permit despite reports that the number of tonnes found in copper mines had been reduced from 10 million to 6.8 million. As late as October 2013, there have been unconfirmed reports that China's Exim Bank has pulled its funding from the project, but a story in Think Africa Press says that the bank has resumed funding. One report states that the disbursement date for the loan was extended from 2014 to 2019. A 2011 study by the accountability NGO Global Witness reported that 24 million USD of the 350 million USD signing bonus was mysteriously diverted into an offshore account in the British Virgin Islands by Sicomines' Congolese partners. In a 2014 paper by Deborah Brautigam and Kevin Gallagher, this is listed as cooper-backed loan for 3 billion USD, which captures only the infrastructure component of the deal and not the entirety of the funds committed by the Exim Bank. STAFF_NOTE: It is unclear whether China Exim Bank is still disbursing funds to this project.

　　刚果（金）是此次援助对象国之一。自今年8月在刚赤道省出现埃博拉确诊病例以来，刚政府和人民为抗击疫情做出了不懈努力。为帮助刚方抗击疫情，中国政府已向刚派遣3名医疗专家，并决定向刚政府援助一批价值500万元人民币的防护救治物资。 　　今年4月和8月，中方先后向西非疫区国家提供了两批总额为3400万元人民币的援助。中方还派遣了100余名医疗专家赴有关国家协助防疫工作，并要求驻疫区国家医疗队坚持工作。目前，共有174名中国医务人员在疫区工作。 (Chinese President, Xi Jinping, announce during his visit in India that China will provide

Feb. 16, 2009 (China Knowledge) - China signed four cooperation agreements totaling US$25 million with Ecuador last Friday to strengthen ties and deepen mutual trust, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The mutually beneficial agreements were signed by visiting Chinese Vice Premier Hui Liangyu and Ecuadorian Vice President Lenin Moreno. China agreed to offer a credit line of RMB 50 million (about US$7.3 million) to boost trade in agricultural products and investment in Ecuador's agricultural sector. China will also grant credit of US $18 million for completion of the Ground Terminal Quitumbe, situated in the south of Quito, according to an arrangement between the State Bank of Ecuador and the China Development Bank. Ecuador will soon set up trade offices in the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou to facilitate trade with China, said Moreno.

China otorgará a Ecuador un crédito sin intereses por 20 millones de dólares, según un acuerdo suscrito este viernes durante la visita a Quito de una delegación encabezada por viceprimer ministro chino, Hui Liangyu, informó la cancillería ecuatoriana. El compromiso está incluido en una serie de instrumentos adoptados por los dos países que prevén, además, una donación por 4,3 millones de dólares, equipos médicos y un acuerdo de financiación por 18 millones de dólares para viales en Quito, según la Cancillería. Hui Liangyu y el vicecanciller chino Song Tao se reunieron con el canciller ecuatoriano, Fander Falconí, para analizar la agenda bilateral. También 'analizaron los efectos de la crisis financiera mundial y cuáles serían los mecanismos pertinentes para afrontarla', agregó Quito. Las relaciones entre los dos países se han intensificado a raíz de la visita oficial que realizó Correa en noviembre de 2007. La balanza comercial con Asia -continente dentro del cual China es el principal mercado- es deficitaria para Ecuador.

(Updates throughout with Finance Minister comments and details about the loan.) By Mercedes Alvaro Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES QUITO (Dow Jones)--Ecuador is negotiating a $2 billion loan with China to finance several projects, Finance Minister Patricio Rivera told reporters in Guayaquil late Tuesday. Andes, Ecuador's state news agency, said the interest rate on the eight-year loan will be 6.9%, and it will have a two- or three-year grace period. The loan underscores the Asian giant's growing role as Ecuador's leading lender since the South American country defaulted on $3.2 billion of government bonds in 2008, effectively losing access to overseas capital markets. Ecuador has also opened the door for China to invest in its considerable oil and mineral resources, with China becoming the largest foreign investor in the resource-rich South American nation. At the same time, the leftist administration of President Rafael Correa has turned its back on the Washington D.C.-based International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Financing from other multilateral lenders such as the Andean Development Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank usually is tied to specific projects. Economists say Correa's government needs the China-sourced liquidity to maintain its high public expenditure. A source close to the negotiations between the two countries told Dow Jones Newswires that the loan will have two tranches, 'one of these could be for $1 billion or $1.4 billion and (won't be tied to specific projects), and the remainder will be for financing specific projects agreed by both sides.' People familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires earlier in the day that Ecuador and China had agreed on a $1 billion loan for the Andean country. The source also said 'it could be possible to get another $1 billion from China.' 'The negotiations for the new loan have been completed. We are in the final stage before signing the loan contract,' said one of the people, who asked not to be named. Meanwhile, a top government official said a team from Ecuador led by officials from the Finance Ministry will travel to China next week to work out some of the details on the loan's conditions. Rivera also said Tuesday that Ecuador has secured a $123 million loan from Russia to finance part of the construction of Toachi-Pilaton hydroelectric power plant. He said the country is negotiating several credit lines with different countries, such as China, Russia and Brazil. In February, Ecuador received a $1 billion pre-payment from China's state-owned PetroChina Co. after the two sides agreed to renew an agreement on the supply of Ecuadorean crude oil for two years, starting in August. In July 2009, state-run Petroecuador and PetroChina signed a similar agreement for Petroecuador to sell Oriente and Napo crude to PetroChina. In August of that year, the Andean country received an advance payment of $1 billion, at an interest rate of 7.25%. Last year, Ecuador's government signed a loan agreement for $1 billion with the China Development Bank Corp., with a fixed interest rate of 6% per year for a four-year term and an additional six-month grace period. -By Mercedes Alvaro, Dow Jones Newswires; 5939-9728-653; mercedes.alvaro@dowjones.com [ 06-14-11 2242ET ] Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Document CM00000020110627e76r0004s China, Ecuador Sign $2 Billion Loan Deal Mercedes Alvaro By Mercedes Alvaro 411 words 28 June 2011 05:35 AM The Wall Street Journal Online WSJO English Copyright 2011 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. QUITO—Ecuador's government on Monday signed a loan for $2 billion with China Development Bank Corp., Ecuador's Finance Ministry said, as China deepens its financial ties with the South American nation. China, seeking to secure energy supplies, has become the largest source of financing for the Andean country, after Ecuador defaulted on its global bonds in 2008. Currently, China's loans to Ecuador exceed $6 billion, including $1.7 billion to finance 85% of Coca-Codo Sinclair, a hydropower plant to be built by China's Sinohydro Corp. in Ecuador, which will supply about 75% of the country's energy needs. The new loan was signed in Beijing by Ecuador's undersecretary of Public Credit, William Vasconez, the ministry said in a press release, without providing further detail. A person close to the negotiations told Dow Jones the $2 billion loan is connected with the sale of 39,000 barrels per day of crude and fuel oil over two years to PetroChina Co. Fernando Villavicencio, a local oil sector analyst, added that 'the loan is to be supported by the sale of oil by state oil company Petroecuador to PetroChina. This is a fact, that Petroecuador should supply oil to PetroChina for two years.' Marco Calvopina, manager of Petroecuador, said that the company is negotiating the sale of crude oil and fuel oil to PetroChina, but that it isn't linked with the $2 billion loan. 'There is not a direct relation with the loan, but we are negotiating a sale,' he said in an interview. Two weeks ago, Finance Minister Patricio Rivera said that the loan will be for eight years, with an interest rate of 6.9%, and a two- or three-year grace period. In February, Ecuador received a $1 billion prepayment from PetroChina after both agreed to renew an agreement on the supply of Ecuadorean crude oil for two years, starting in August. In July 2009, Petroecuador and PetroChina signed a similar agreement for Petroecuador to sell Oriente and Napo crude to PetroChina. In August of that year, the Andean country received an advance payment of $1 billion, at an interest rate of 7.25%. Last year, Ecuador's government signed a loan agreement for $1 billion with the China Development Bank, with a fixed interest rate of 6% per year for a four-year term and an additional six-month grace period.

All Rights Reserved. State-run China National PetroChemical Corporation (Sinopec) have offered Ecuadorian ex president Alfredo Palacio's administration to invest 6 billion dollars to develop exclusively the Ecuadorian oil field Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT), in the Amazonian region. Also, Sinopec proposed to split profits with Ecuadorian State 50%-50%. Sinopec proposed last year to anticipate production, with a maximum extraction target of 160,000 barrels a day in 2010. But a local commision recommended Petroecuador's Board to develop the project through a bid open to state-run companies with strategic alliances or cooperation agreements with Ecuador, in order to be adapted to the Hydrocarbons Law. Petroecuador plans to provide block, environmental, social, and economic information it has available about Block ITT and its areas of influence. Meanwhile, Petrobras, Enap, and Sinopec commit to present, jointly, a proposal to confirm the Block's reserve, development, and production. This proposal will include a preliminary development plan for the existing fields and others that may be discovered in the block, in addition to the analysis to build an up-grader plant to improve the oil produced and to build an electric plant that will use this industrial treatment unit's residues as fuel. Block ITT, which covers an area of some 190,000 hectares, is located below the easternmost portion of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region. Its main fields are Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini, among a total of five discovered there so far. China National PetroChemical Corporation (Sinopec) is China's second oil company. It is a vertically integrated firm with activities in oil, gas and chemicals industries. © 2007 NoticiasFinancieras - NoticiasFinancieras - All rights reserved Global Network Content Services LLC Document NFINCE0020070411e34b0005l Sinopec y PetroEcuador firman memorando para explotar el yacimiento ITT 532 words 26 March 2007 03:44 AM Agencia EFE - Servicio Económico EFESE Spanish Copyright 2007 Agencia EFE. All Rights Reserved Pekín, 26 mar (EFE).- Las petroleras estatales china Sinopec y ecuatoriana PetroEcuador han firmado un memorando de entendimiento (MOU) para la explotación conjunta del mayor yacimiento de Ecuador, el de Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT). El acuerdo consiste en un 'contrato de asociación, según establece la ley, en el que cada parte cuenta con un 50 por ciento', dijo hoy a Efe el embajador de Ecuador en China, Rodrigo Yepez Enríquez. El yacimiento ITT se abrió en 2005, cuenta con unas reservas estimadas de casi 5.000 millones de barriles y probadas de casi mil millones, y su explotación supone una inversión de 5.000 millones de dólares. Cuatro empresas participarán en la explotación conjunta del ITT, ya que también se cuenta con Petroleo Brasileiro SA y la chilena ENAP (Empresa Nacional de Petróleo) para ese proyecto, según informó hoy el diario chino 'Economic Information Daily'. 'Brasil y Chile participarán a través de Sinopec, ya que son subcontratistas' de esta firma, la mayor refinería de China, dijo Yepez. ITT está localizado en pleno Amazonas, y una vez iniciada su explotación se espera que su producción diaria alcance los 165.000 barriles de crudo. Tras la firma del MOU, 'ahora deben empezar a explorar para ver dónde está el petróleo exactamente, para establecer los pozos. Ese paso sería el siguiente y a continuación empezarían a explotar', aseguró el embajador. En la ceremonia de firma del MOU, en Quito, asistieron el nuevo presidente de PetroEcuador, Carlos Pareja, el ministro de Industria Raúl Sagasti, el gerente general de Sinopec en Ecuador, Ding Jingjun, y el asistente de gerencia Zhou Baixiu. Sagasti anunció durante la ceremonia otra posible inversión: 'El Gobierno de Ecuador apoya que Sinopec amplíe su inversión en el sector petrolero ecuatoriano, por lo que también desea que participe de forma activa en la licitación del proyecto petroquímico de refinado de Manta', anunció el ministro. Sinopec es una de las compañías chinas que junto con otra decena de empresas están interesadas en el proyecto de Manta, que se llevaría a cabo también en asociación con PetroEcuador, con una futura capacidad de procesado de hasta 300.000 barriles diarios y una inversión de 4.000 millones de dólares. De conseguirlo una empresa china, el resto de empresas extranjeras podrían también participar en Manta de la misma forma que lo han hecho en ITT o mediante una asociación conjunta. El proyecto de Manta fue anunciado el mes pasado por el nuevo presidente de Ecuador, el izquierdista Rafael Correa, de 43 años, quien señaló que esperaba que PetroEcuador tenga una participación del 60 por ciento. La construcción de esta planta requeriría unos cinco años. Ecuador se encuentra entre los 30 mayores productores de petróleo del mundo, el quinto de Latinoamérica, con 539.000 barriles diarios, una producción de la que exporta un 69 por ciento. Por su parte, China considera a Ecuador y Bolivia entre los nueve países calificados de 'apropiados' por el gobierno del Partido Comunista de China (PCCh, en el poder desde 1949) para que sus empresas petroleras y de gas efectúen inversiones (junto con Kuwait, Qatar, Omán, Marruecos, Libia, Níger y Noruega).

All Rights Reserved. The state-owned oil and gas companies China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec) and Ecuadorian Petroecuador will jointly develop Ecuador's largest crude oil deposit Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT), under recently signed memorandum of understanding, media reported on March 26, 2007. The memorandum of understanding envisages an association in which each of the parties will hold 50 pct, Ecuador's Ambassador to China, Rodrigo Yepez Enriquez, said. The ITT deposit was opened in 2005 and has estimated reserves of some 5.0 billion barrels and proven reserves of almost 1.0 billion barrels of oil. The deposit's operation needs $5.0 bln (3.77 bln euro) investments. The ITT deposit will be developed also in cooperation with Brazil's state-owned oil and gas giant Petrobras and Chilean state-owned oil and gas company ENAP. ITT is located in the Amazon region and its daily output is seen at 165,000 barrels of crude oil. Ecuador was South America's fifth largest crude oil producer with some 540,000 barrels of oil per day in 2006. Crude oil is the country's largest source of revenue.

All rights reserved. China's Sinopec has signed an agreement to jointly develop one of Ecuador's largest oil fields with three other companies, Chinese media reports said Monday. Sinopec signed a memorandum of understanding last week with state Petroecuador, Brazil's Petrobras and Chile's Enap to develop the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) oil field. According to Sinopec's general manager in Ecuador, Ding Jingjun, total investment for the field has been estimated at $5 billion. Earlier this month, Petroecuador indicated it would invest about $1.5 billion at some of its key fields between 2008 and 2014, much of the money going to ITT (OD Mar.15,p1). The field could potentially produce up to 165,000 b/d when it goes into production, Ding was quoted as saying. ITT is 200 miles east of Quito in the Amazon Basin. The field contains heavy crude, with reserves of about 4 billion bbl, of which 1 billion bbl are thought recoverable. Spain's Repsol YPF and India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp. were also reportedly interested in the project (OD Jul.20,p7). Energy Intelligence Group Inc Document TOILDA0020070403e33r00008 Ecuador's ITT could reach 752,500 b/d of heavy crude STEPHAN KUEFFNER Stephan Kueffner skueffner@gmail.com, Stephan Kueffner 979 words 30 August 2013 Platts Oilgram News PON ISSN: 0163-1284, Volume 91, Issue 171 English (c) 2013 McGraw-Hill, Inc. Ecuador's crude oil output could reach a peak of 752,500 b/d in 2019 if the contentious development of the Ishpingo-Tiputini-Tambococha heavy crude field goes ahead, according to government documents obtained by Platts Wednesday. This is about 30% higher than country's record daily output of 540,000 b/d reached on July 29. The documents form the basis of the request by president Rafael Correa to the National Assembly to be allowed to develop the field inside the Yasuni National Park, an Amazon rainforest preserve which is home to one of the world's most diverse animal and plant habitats. 'We're definitely facing a project that guarantees a sustainable development model, environmentally balanced and respectful of cultural diversity, and with the firm commitment of conserving biodiversity and ensuring the satisfaction of the fundamental needs of our country's inhabitants,' Correa wrote in his request. Under the 2008 constitution that he championed, congress must approve oil development in protected areas. Correa tasked the oil, economy, justice, and environment ministries with writing documents to support the request for development of the oil field, after dropping an environmental plan to keep the field's oil underground on August 15. According to the oil ministry's report, the ITT field holds a proven 607 million barrels of crude, with 917.7 million proven and probable reserves, divided nearly equally between the Ishpingo and the Tiputini-Tambococha areas. The field holds total possible reserves of up to 1.3 billion barrels, the ministry estimated, but it used the 917.7 million barrel figure as the basis for the government's projections for output and revenue. Current technology would allow Petroamazonas, the upstream unit of state oil company Petroecuador, to extract 91% of the oil, or 838 million barrels, from the field. Investment through 2022 would cost $5.59 billion, without including any eventual cleanup costs, while production is estimated to last 23 years. Average output costs for the ITT field would run at $12/barrel. Moving the heavy, 14-degree API oil to port near Esmeraldas on the Pacific Ocean would cost $1.46/b. Pipelines to be built Petroamazonas aims to build 30 kilometers of main pipelines within the park and another 81.5 kilometers south of the Napo River to its liquids separation plant on Block 12 at Eden-Yuturi, where the ITT crude would be mixed with lighter crude from Blocks 12 and 31. While the government's request for permission to extract oil from the park includes Block 31, Petroamazonas began to develop that block's Apaika-Nenke field in early 2012, without congressional approval. The report cites a 2010 Ryder Scott estimate for Block 31 reserves of 279.4 million barrels. In a separate news report Wednesday, Petroamazonas head Oswaldo Madrid said Block 31 could produce 18,000-20,000 b/d from 20 wells, according to official government newswire Andes. If development of the ITT field begins next year as currently planned, the Tambococha area, which lies outside the park and under the Napo River, could start pumping oil in 2016, followed eight months later by Tiputini and then by Ishpingo in 2018. Tiputini output would peak at 62,000 b/d in 2017, Tambococha at 110,000 b/d in its fourth year, and Ishpingo at 130,000 b/d in its seventh year. Combined, the ITT is projected to reach peak output of 200,000 b/d in 2018 or 2019, requiring three production platforms each at Tiputini and Tambococha and five at Ishpingo. Development would include a total of 360 oil wells—300 inside the national park—and at least three platforms for the reinjection of formation water. Pipelines would run underground and be fitted with safeguards to cause automatic shutdowns in the event of accidents. Access roads would be 10 meters wide, according to the oil ministry report. The government estimates that it would break even on the ITT project in 2016. It would gain $41.77 billion from the field through 2036, according to its base scenario, assuming average prices of $70/b for the oil. Ecuador has, however, also received Chinese funds in loans backed in oil called 'advance oil sales' by the government. This month, it received another Chinese loan for $1.2 billion backed in oil at an undisclosed interest rate. Similar earlier deals have had an interest rate near 7%. Protests sparked Correa's decision to go ahead with developing the ITT field after six years of campaigning against it has sparked protests among environmentalists and indigenous organizations. Demonstrations have drawn hundreds in numerous cities, including Quito, the capital. Correa argues that Ecuador needs the ITT's revenue to help combat poverty. Critics point to Ecuador's 40-year experience producing oil, which has not eliminated poverty, and which has saddled some areas with oil-related pollution and sparked a controversial lawsuit against US oil major Chevron. Besides demanding congressional approval for oil production and mining in protected areas, Ecuador's constitution also bans any such activity in the territories of its two remaining isolated Amazon indigenous tribes. While it was promoting the environmental option to leave the ITT undeveloped, the government said these tribes inhabited the ITT/Block 43 area, some 40% of which is outside the park to the north and in a strip along the border with Peru. In the new documents submitted to congress, however, the justice ministry denies any evidence of their presence in the areas slated for development. The Ishpingo deposit's southern end juts into an 'intangible' area of the Yasuni park in which any economic activity is banned.

The 420-km railway link is to be used for trade and transport, and is to be built mainly by Chinese contractors. However, the proposed link to Kunming, the capital of China's Yunnan Province, has been dogged by delays and uncertainty since the initial agreement. The planned Kunming-Vientiane rail would add on to existing railroad infrastructure currently being build as a part of Trans-Asian Railway, facilitating a larger Kunming-Bangkok route by no later than 2020. As of March 2015, Laotian deputy prime minister, Somsavat Lengsavad, said Laos hopes to reach an agreement with Beijing by June. Under the envisaged arrangement, Vientiane would provide $840 million in initial financing, with $1.26 billion coming from China. The balance of just under $5 billion would be borrowed from the Export-Import Bank of China by a joint venture company established to build and operate the $7 billion rail link between Kunming and Vientiane. The venture would eventually be transferred to Laotian ownership. The $7 billion price tag amounts to more than 60% of Laos' gross domestic product, and the Asian Development Bank has warned that the project could leave Laos overburdened with debt.","210","Transport and Storage","","12","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Laos","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFPR000020121116e8bg005k9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DPAEN00020121116e8bg0018h&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DPAEN00020121019e8aj00106&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJ00000020121024e8ao0001v&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFPR000020100430e64u004ef&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020101207e6c7000bi&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PRTRIN0020101209e6c8000dg&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNHA000020101230e6cu0008f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=TGASIA0020121025e6c9001f4&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/railway-08192014182800.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/laos-china-prepare-to-sign-railway-construction-contract-03132015135705.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=INHT000020130102e9120002t&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/railway-07172013174609.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/SEA-01-070613.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/railway-project-10062014181543.html, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/Laos?page=2, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/hyyj/20150316/104421729543.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eastbysoutheast.com/tag/china-trains/, Media Report, including Wikileaks","18","","","","","","","Checked","1","OOF-like","3","Mixed (Some Development)","6","Active","1","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFPR000020121116e8bg005k9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DPAEN00020121116e8bg0018h&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DPAEN00020121019e8aj00106&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJ00000020121024e8ao0001v&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFPR000020100430e64u004ef&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020101207e6c7000bi&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PRTRIN0020101209e6c8000dg&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNHA000020101230e6cu0008f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=TGASIA0020121025e6c9001f4&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=INHT000020130102e9120002t&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","5000000000","USD","1.189796","1","4202401084","5000000000","","","1","Laos","812","745","Laos","LAO","LA","418","544","FALSE","FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","","","","","","07/24/15 04:10 AM","","","1"

The loan will finance the natural gas pipeline linking Mtwara gas field to Dar es Salaam.

During construction, there were fatal riots over the pipeline by Mtwara residents who wanted to see the newly discovered fuel stimulate their local economy before being transported across country. After the police regained control, the Tanzanian government assured that the construction work would continue. ???????????????????????? 2015/04/09 ???????????????10??????4?8?,?????????????�???????�????,??????????????????????(????),??????????????,??????????????????????????:?? ????????????????????????? ?? ???,?????????,???????????????????????????????????????,???????????,??????????????? ???????????�??????�??????? ???2013?9???,??????????????4????????????,2014?7-9?,?2????????????3???,????????5.339???,?2013????4.1????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????,????????????????????????????,???????,?????????,?????????????????????????????,?????????????????????,?????100?(???500?)????????????,???????????????,??????????????????????????????:�???100???????????,????????,????????�? ?? ?????????,?????,????????????????? ??????,??????????????,?????100?????????????????????????????????????,???????????????????????????�?????�??????,???????????????????????????,???????????????? ?????????????????????? ????????????,???????????????????,?????????,2013???37????????,????90%??????????????????????????????,????????????,????????????????,??,????????????????????????????????????�????????�?????,??,2014?,?????????????25???,??????19?????,?6000??????????????

According to subsequent sources, the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) was able to secure this loan in 2012 and the Tanzania Port Authority began seeking construction companies to execute the expansion. Most recently, CCCC has sought litigation against the Tanzania Port Authority over the contract. CCCC contends that the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport decided to call for new tenders before termination of the contract and awarded the tender to contractors other than the CCCC on grounds that the ministry had been directed by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority not to deal with the company as it was among those banned by the World Bank. CCCC argues that it secured funding for the project from China Exim Bank and China and had invested a total of 523,131,015.97 USD in the contract.

This includes runway expansion, a 17 thousand square meter terminal, a small power station, and a larger apron. Zanzibar borrowed 70 million USD from Export-Import Bank of China to complete the projects. Beijing Construction Engineering Group was responsible for implementing the construction of the passenger terminal, which began in 2011 with the construction expected to last 18 months. Work was brought to a halt in 2012 so that it could be inspected by ADPI, a French engineering and architectural firm. Based on ADPI's recommendations, the Zanzibar government chose to remodel the construction at a cost of 115 million USD. This came with criticism of the work done by Beijing Construction Engineering Group. Zanzibar's government secured a 30-year preferential loan of 73.85 million USD for the work (#33736). It is also reported that the World Bank is now providing funding for the project. The whole project was previously estimated to cost 70.4 million USD. The commitment date for this project is unknown.

Once implementation began in February 2012, estimates of the whole project costs total $704 million yuan, although Tanzania had only secured 481 million.

The project was discussed in the Zanzibar house of representatives in August 2013, where legislators Mbaroul Wadi Mussa and Hamza Hassan Juma expressed concertn over the 'shoddy work' at the airport. The terminal's architectural problems prompted the Zanzibar government to hire ADPI France Company for further evaluation. ADPI later proved the work required re-designing. Multiple reports suggest that the loan provided for the construction of this project is concessional and from the EXIM-Bank; however, because we do not have the financial terms of the 30-yr loans, we cannot classify it as ODA.

"14235","2011","FALSE","On May 5, 2011, the Ugandan parliament approved a 350 million USD concessional loan with two percent interest from China's Exim Bank for the construction of a toll road from Entebbe Airport to the capital Kampala. The road is expected to cost 476 million USD, with 126 million USD of the funding coming from the Ugandan government. The loan from China required that the consulting and construction companies used for the project be Chinese. The China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) was chosen to implement the project. The four-lane highway will feature at least four toll stations. It also will include four interchanges with overpasses, along with a connection to the new highway to Munyonyo, Uganda�s major international conference destination. The link between the new highway and Munyonyo will include a 3-km-long, two-lane bridge constructed to run over a Nile River marshland that cuts across the proposed road link. Construction was expected to begin around July 2012, with the project taking three years to complete. On November 21, 2012, President Yoweri Museveni Wednesday officially launched the project at a ground-breaking ceremony at Kyengera, off the Kampala-Masaka road. According to an executive of the Uganda National Roads Authority, Peter Ssebanakitta, the first 6km of the road have been handed over to the contractor to start work. Compensation of residents affected by the construction is underway, with 250 people so far paid. The most recently found update from Red Pepper in 2014 states that CCCC is to construct an additional 9 km, but stated the project would cost 150 million USD.","210","Transport and Storage","Road/Highway Construction","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Uganda","http://www.chimpreports.com/index.php/special-reports/5133-investigation-unra-resists-sabotage-museveni-clears-entebbe-expressway.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eturbonews.com/22640/outgoing-uganda-parliament-approves-funding-new-entebbe-highway, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AER0000020110505e75500013&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=ENR0000020110411e7440000f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020101224e6co001bd&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=TARGNS0020091110e5b9002ra&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://allafrica.com/stories/201208050119.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/637511-museveni-commissions-kampala-entebbe-road.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://search.proquest.com.gate2.library.lse.ac.uk/docview/1352727492/13EA99DC4904AFE08CA/3?accountid=9630, Other; http://allafrica.com/stories/201211210482.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://opm.go.ug/manage/pdfs2013/GAPR2011_12V2.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://opm.go.ug/manage/pdfs2013/GAPR2011_12V1.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://aiddata.org/opening-development#uganda_crowdsourcing, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFRNNW0020130327e93j0000z&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020130409e94900136&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.redpepper.co.ug/unra-announces-changes-on-kampala-entebbe-express-highway/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.unra.go.ug/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=263:entebbe-express-highway&catid=43:on-going-projects&Itemid=66#, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entebbe-Kampala_Highway, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.newvision.co.ug/mobile/Detail.aspx?NewsID=635784&CatID=1, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.newvision.co.ug/mobile/Detail.aspx?NewsID=637472&CatID=3, Media Report, including Wikileaks","20","Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency","China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), State-Owned Company","Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency; China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), State-Owned Company","2","Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), Government Agency; Uganda Investment Authority (UIA), Government Agency; Uganda National Economy Committee, Government Agency","3","Checked","1","ODA-like","2","Development","1","Active","1","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AER0000020110505e75500013&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=ENR0000020110411e7440000f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020101224e6co001bd&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=TARGNS0020091110e5b9002ra&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFRNNW0020130327e93j0000z&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020130409e94900136&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","350000000","USD","1.206344778","1","290132644","350000000","07/01/12","","1","Uganda","500","285","Uganda","UGA","UG","800","746","FALSE","FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","Concessional","2","20","5","54.08","04/09/15 02:41 PM","Entebbe, Uganda to Kampala, Uganda; Munyonyo, Uganda","Daniel Alinange, Spokesperson ; Mott MacDonald, Project Engineer ; Sun Heping, Chinese ambassador to Uganda ; Yoweri Museveni, President ; Peter Ssebanakitta, Executive (Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA))","1"

Uganda Gets IMF OK to Raise Debt Limit; Move Aimed at Allowing East African Nation to Fund Needed Hydroelectric Projects Nicholas Bariyo Nicholas Bariyo 374 words 27 January 2014 06:00 AM The Wall Street Journal Online WSJO WSJ.com English Copyright 2014 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. KAMPALA, Uganda—The International Monetary Fund has cleared Uganda to increase its debt ceiling on non-concessional borrowing by up to 47%, to allow the East African nation to fund ambitious hydroelectric projects aimed at addressing chronic power shortages. The country's borrowing limit has been increased to $2.2 billion from $1.5 billion, a boost for the country's efforts to access funds to meet its widening budget deficit, Ana Lucia Coronel, the IMF's senior resident representative in Uganda, said Monday. The development is a relief for Africa's top robusta coffee grower and fledging oil producer; Uganda has been grappling with a widening budget deficit for the past two years, as spending has increased while funds from donors waned. 'The allowed increase is expected to finance electricity projects that are critical to close the acute infrastructure gap that makes Uganda one of the countries with the lowest levels of electrification in Africa,' Ms. Coronel said. Rating firm Standard & Poor's Corp. recently lowered Uganda's credit rating to B from B+, citing the widening deficit. The country's largest donors, including the European Union and the World Bank, froze aid in 2012, citing high levels of corruption in government. Until 2012, donors were funding around 30% of the country's annual budget. China's Sinohydro Group Ltd. is building the 600 megawatt Karuma hydro power plant on the River Nile, while China International Water and Electric Corp. is implementing the 183 megawatt Isimba hydro power projects, both located along the White Nile, a tributary of the Nile. The projects, being funded by concessional loans provided by Exim Bank of China, are expected to enable Uganda to meet rising local and regional electricity demand. Ms. Coronel said the IMF expects Uganda to get favorable borrowing terms in the continuing negotiations with the Chinese lenders. 'If well managed, the projects look commercially viable according to the information provided to the IMF,' she said. 'The terms of this financing will compare favorably to a potential issue of a bond in international markets and to issuance of domestic debt.' Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Provided by Syndigate.info, an Albawaba.com company By Vision Reporter Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi has said the Government is encouraging foreign direct investments after discovering several commercial quantities of mineral, oil and gas deposits to enable the country attain middle-income status within the next three years. 'We have induced an environment that is fully supportive of foreign direct investment, and we feel we are valued partners because Africa's voice is beginning to be heard internationally in the quest for development,' he said. The PM was meeting a delegation from the China-Africa Development Fund, the largest Chinese private equity that focuses on stimulating and facilitating Chinese investments in Africa, at his office this week. The fund will finance the proposed $620m mining project in Osukuru hills in Tororo district, undertaken by a Chinese company, Guangzhou Dongsong Energy Group, which is prospecting for base metals, phosphates and uranium on 26sqkm covering 14 villages. According to a release from the Prime Minister's Office, Mbabazi said Tororo has the second largest phosphate deposits in Africa, with exploitation estimated to last 35 years. Under the project, the company will produce 300,000 tonnes each of fertilisers and steel annually, establish a 200,000-tonne annual capacity sulfuric acid plant and also build a 5-MW power plant in the area. Mbabazi commended China for standing by Uganda, saying the country is an example to Africa in her revolutionary struggles against foreign domination. Lu Qingcheng, the vice-president of China-Africa Development Fund, who led the eightmember delegation, said the fund, which was founded in 2006 by former Chinese president Hu Jintao, is a channel for sustainable Sino-Africa cooperation. 'My visit has cemented my confidence in the project as one of the key investments towards Vision 2040 that will drive Chinese partnerships,' said Qingcheng, adding that he was impressed with the scale of the Tororo project.

Leading EXIM Bank President, Li Riogu, CCCC and the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) officials on a tour of the expressway’s construction site in Busega recently, Byabagambi said tenders for the management of toll plazas would be advertised in 2015.'I am sure we will advertise tenders for a private operator to manage the tolls in 2015 so that by the time of commissioning of the road (in 2016), we will have the private operator in place,' he said. The government plans to repay the $350m plus the principle to EXIM Bank courtesy of returns from toll revenues over a 25-year period. No toll fee has yet been fixed. 'The road will be like the Bujagali hydro power project. Users will pay a high toll fee but once we are through, it will go down tremendously,' said Byabagambi. At completion, the Kampala- Entebbe expressway will be the first toll road of its kind operated on a fee for service basis, with restricted access for intruders animals and people through fencing to facilitate mobility especially for new alignment between Busega and Abayita Ababiri. 'All motorists will pay to use the road,' said Byabagambi. 'I think even bicycle owners will pay because it will be a high speed road fenced-off with exclusion zones so that no cow or pedestrian goes through on to the road. There will also be no hump on the road so if a vehicle is driving a 100km/ hr and knocks a pedestrian, he or she will obviously die!' Whilst 15kms of right of way have been acquired courtesy of compensation of property owners along the road stretch, David Luyimbazi, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) director of planning, noted that there were challenges in compensation of property owners. 'We have challenges of absentee landlords, mortgaged land and wrangles over the compensation prices, but we are in the process of addressing this problem (of compensation),' he said. Byabagambi revealed that some landlords challenged the government valuers estimation of their land and properties, adding that recently, the Solicitor General agreed that UNRA get way lease. 'If the property owners petition court and it (court) decides that we have to pay them more money, we shall do so, but works should continue because the constitution even allows us to use land belonging to individuals and only pay them later. We should have acquired half of right of way if not for delays in compensation,' he said. Li promised more bilateral cooperation between China and Uganda to improve Uganda’s infrastructure. 'We (Chinese) work seven days a week,' he said. 'You have to tell your people (support staff) to work hard just like CCCC to complete the project in time.' Global Data Point Ltd.

All Rights Reserved Caracas, 22 dic (EFECOM).- Venezuela y China firmaron hoy varios nuevos acuerdos de cooperación, entre ellos varios petroleros y financieros, como un contrato de venta de 500.000 barriles diarios de crudo venezolano al país asiático y una línea de crédito china por 1.000 millones de dólares para proyectos mineros venezolanos. Los documentos fueron suscritos durante la clausura de la VIII Comisión Mixta de Alto Nivel chino venezolano, instalada ayer, acto que fue encabezada por el presidente venezolano, Hugo Chávez, y el ministro de la Comisión Nacional de Reforma y Desarrollo de China, Zhang Ping. 'Son 29 acuerdos' los alcanzados durante la reunión, 'pero se firmaron sólo 15' durante el acto oficial por razones de tiempo, declaró Chávez durante su discurso, en el que alabó a China como 'una gran potencia, pero para el bien' porque 'ha demostrado que no hace falta agredir a los más débiles' para serlo. Entre los convenios alcanzados destacan los del área energética, como el 'contrato de suministro de 500.000 barriles diarios de crudo y productos por un año' firmado entre la estatal Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) y Petro China. Según datos chinos, Venezuela es el cuarto país suministrador de petróleo de China y su quinto socio comercial en América Latina y el Caribe. A principios de este año PDVSA informó de que suministraba 331.000 barriles diarios de crudo a China y de que tenía planes de elevarlos hasta 'un millón de barriles/día en plazo de cuatro años'. Venezuela y China también firmaron un acuerdo marco para crear una empresa mixta de refino en el estado venezolano llanero de Guárico y un convenio para ejecutar un estudio de cuantificación y certificación de reservas petroleras en el Bloque Boyacá 3 de la Faja del Orinoco. La estatal petrolera china CNPC participa, junto con empresas de Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Ecuador, España, India e Irán, en el proceso internacional de certificación de las reservas de la rica Faja del Orinoco, calculadas en forma preliminar en 234.000 millones de barriles de crudos pesados y extrapesados. Esas reservas, sumadas a las ya confirmadas de 80.000 millones de barriles en otras zonas de Venezuela, sitúan al país como la mayor reserva petrolera del planeta, con 314.000 millones de barriles. Caracas y Pekín firmaron este martes un 'acuerdo marco para construir y administrar una empresa mixta de producción de hidrocarburos en el Bloque Junín 8' de la Faja del Orinoco, con 'el objeto de producir 200.000 barriles diarios de crudo extrapesado', según la información oficial. Además, suscribieron un 'memorando de entendimiento' para que empresas chinas presten 'servicios de perforación costa afuera en aguas profundas y ultra profundas' venezolanas. En materia eléctrica, Caracas y Pekín firmaron 'un acta compromiso para promover cooperación' y 'desarrollar y construir proyectos conjuntos hirdroeléctricos'. En el área financiera, la estatal Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) y el Banco Chino de Desarrollo firmaron un 'contrato para abrir una línea de crédito por 1.000 millones de dólares', para financiar los proyectos mineros en el sur venezolano. Durante la reunión de alto nivel también se concretaron un pacto en el área de 'acuicultura de peces' y otro para desarrollar 'la tercera etapa del proyecto de rehabilitación integral del sistema de riego río Guárico'. Igualmente, se acordó un 'convenio de cooperación para formación de funcionarios públicos en el área de Planificación' entre escuelas de los dos países. A lo largo de su discurso, Chávez destacó el reforzamiento de las relaciones bilaterales, especialmente desde su llegada al Gobierno venezolano hace una década. Por su parte, Zhang Ping habló de los 'mutuos resultados de la cooperación' bilateral, y resaltó 'la gran importancia' que el Gobierno chino otorga 'a las relaciones con Venezuela'.

This project is expected to benefit more than 100 thousand new users within Bolivia and will help develop the National Program for Exploration and Exploitation under the Bolivian oil field project: YPFB. The Ministry of Economic Development and Public Finance will establish the transfer of reimbursable resources and is responsible for compliance with the conditions governing the loan agreement.

Que en el marco de las Políticas y Estrategias señaladas en el numeral 4.4.1 (Hidrocarburos) del Capítulo IV (Bolivia Productiva), el Estado busca garantizar la seguridad energética nacional y consolidar al país como centro energético regional, a través del cambio de una matriz energética que incluya el programa de masificación de las instalaciones de gas natural. Que el Proyecto “Gas Domiciliario 39K”, tiene como objetivo orientar sus acciones a la ampliación de redes de distribución de gas natural y la adquisición de equipos de perforación e intervención de pozos en campos existentes y nuevas prospecciones. Que el “Export - Import Bank of China”, ha acordado conceder al Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, un préstamo con características concesionales de hasta $us60.000.000.- (SESENTA MILLONES 00/100 DÓLARES ESTADOUNIDENSES), destinados a financiar el Proyecto “Gas Domiciliario 39K”. Que los recursos que se destinen a la instalación de redes de distribución de gas natural domiciliario, permitirán beneficiar a más de cien mil (100.000) nuevos usuarios dentro del territorio boliviano tanto en ciudades como en poblaciones intermedias. Que Bolivia cuenta con reservas de hidrocarburos probadas y probables considerables, para lo cual es de vital importancia la perforación de pozos a fin de habilitar estas reservas para el consumo nacional y para cumplir con los compromisos asumidos a nivel internacional. Que en la actualidad existen proyectos rezagados en cuanto a perforación e intervención de pozos, debido a la falta de equipos de perforación, ya que las compañías que realizan esta actividad en el país son reducidas, aspecto que además afecta la tarifa de servicios de perforación. Que los dos (2) equipos de perforación a adquirirse con los recursos del préstamo del “Export - Import Bank of China” se utilizarán para el desarrollo del Programa Nacional de Exploración y Explotación, bajo la conducción de Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos – YPFB, ya sea por las filiales de YPFB o por las empresas que cuenten con Contratos de Operación.

The first section of this scheme was established in 2008 for $6 billion, of which $2 billion were allocated by Fonden [National Development Fund] and $4 billion was the credit from the China Development Bank, which was cancelled in 2011. In order to continue feeding this scheme, in June 2011 the loan was renewed for $4 billion more and Fonden once again transferred $2 billion. The financing provided by the Asian institution was paid this year and in July its renewal for $4 billion was agreed, amount that was transferred to the reserves last week. The second section was authorized in 2009, and like the first, it was created with $6 billion; $4 billion that corresponded to the loan from the Bank of China and $2 billion from Fonden. This initial funding was paid in 2012. In August 2012, the additional $4 billion loan was negotiated and it is still being paid. The third section was created in 2013, and like the other two sections, manages $6 billion. To constitute it, China lent $5 billion and Fonden transferred $1 billion. The other scheme, the Large Volume Fund, executes a $20 million line of credit divided in: 50 percent in dollars and 50 percent in renminbi.

Noticias24) A propósito del anuncio del presidente Nicolás Maduro por la detención de cinco personas vinculadas al desfalco del Fondo Chino, mostramos una serie de puntos que harán entender el funcionamiento del mismo. El “Fondo Chino” es un fondo de cooperación binacional para el financiamiento de proyectos en Venezuela y está formado por aportes del Banco de Desarrollo Chino (CDB) y del Fonden. A continuación las claves para conocer el Fondo Conjunto Chino Venezolano: - China y Venezuela expandieron su cooperación comercial impulsado por la alianza estratégica entre los presidentes Hugo Chávez y Hu Jintao; así como por los crecientes financiamientos que el Banco de Desarrollo de China (BDC) ha otorgado al gobierno venezolano desde el año 2007. - El Fondo Chino nació en 2007, y fue oficializado de la siguiente manera: Fondo Pesado I, se firmó en noviembre de 2007 y culminó en noviembre de 2010; Fondo Pesado II en febrero 2009 y culminó en febrero 2012; y el Gran volumen se firmó en septiembre de 2010 y culmina en septiembre de 2020. - Está conformado por el Ministerio del Poder Popular de Planificación y Desarrollo como representante de Venezuela y la Comisión Nacional de Desarrollo y Reforma de China por el país asiático. - Su finalidad es impulsar el desarrollo socioproductivo e industrial de Venezuela, a través de la ejecución de proyectos de gran envergadura en diferentes áreas como industria ligera y pesada, infraestructura, participación social, desarrollo energético, educación. - La ejecución de los proyectos estará ubicado en el territorio de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela. - Los proyectos deberán estar enmarcados dentro del Plan de Desarrollo Económico y Social, las políticas sectoriales y los programas sociales vigentes que desarrolla el Ejecutivo Nacional. Así como deben tener un alto impacto social, que contribuya a mejorar los niveles de vida de las comunidades del área de influencia, de alto nivel de generación de empleo y sostenibilidad. - El fundamento legal que sostiene la gestión institucional del Fondo Conjunto Chino Venezolano abarca la Constitución de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela; la Ley Orgánica de la Contraloría General de la República y del Sistema Nacional de Control Fiscal; la Ley Orgánica de la Administración Pública; la Ley Orgánica de Planificación; la Ley Orgánica de la Administración Financiera del Sector Público; Ley de Creación del Fondo para el Desarrollo Endógeno; el Decreto con Rango, Valor y Fuerza de Ley del Banco de Desarrollo Económico y Social de Venezuela (Bandes). - Los órganos que ejercerán evaluación e inspección de las actividades y operaciones del Fondo Chino son: la Contraloría General de la República, la Superintendencia Nacional de Auditoria Interna y la Unidad de Auditoria Interna de Bandes. 外媒：中国对委内瑞拉资助40亿美元贷款 2014-11-19 11:03:26　来源: 网易财经 12 网易财经11月19日讯 据路透社消息，委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗周二表示，委政府已将中国对其的资助款项计入外汇储备，总计40亿美元。此前，外国投资者一度对委不断缩水的外汇储备表示忧虑。 委内瑞拉财政部长Rodolfo Marco即将前往中国商讨金融合作事宜。 “委内瑞拉外汇储备本周将增加40亿美元，从而大幅增强外汇储备量。”Marco表示。 Marco发表声明后，截止当天时间下午，委内瑞拉央行的网站显示，其外汇储备已由194亿美元增加到215亿美元。 委内瑞拉外汇储备去年年初减少到298亿美元，并与上周减到自2003年以来最低。一旦40亿美元全部入账，其外汇储备将增加到自去年8月以来最高。 经济学家表示，40亿美元款项很可能来自中国与委内瑞拉共同基金，其中包括来自中国的贷款，或者是一项名为Fonden的发展基金。 “如果来自中国的贷款计入到委内瑞拉外汇储备中，委政府的资金将更公开透明。”美国银行经济学家弗朗西斯·罗德里格斯表示，“这样，这笔钱也显然可以用于还债。” 今年九月，马杜罗总统表示，委内瑞拉央行的一项基金将注资，帮助委内瑞拉重拾偿还外债的信心。 此后，委内瑞拉的债券平均下降了28%，摩根大通数据显示。 华尔街分析师表示，外国投资者纷纷远离委内瑞拉，原因是他们认为委政府没有实行宏观经济改革，包括对外汇交易的规定，与玻利瓦尔的贬值。 (Venezuela has include the $ 4 billion Chinese aid into its foreign exchange reserves.

This project received 19.5 million USD of funding from the Fondo Pesado (China-Venezuela Joint Financing Fund). Unclear how much comes from China exactly. In 2009, Chavez publicized the ZTE C366 “el Vergatario”, which was produced to show the technological capacity of the plant.

"30287","2012","FALSE","In March 2012, China offered to help pay for the rehabilitation of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) rail lines. The agreement provided a grant of $23.5 million (K123 billion) for the rehabilitation of the railway line and infrastructure. China also provided a $42.6 million (K223 billion) interest-free loan to revive the operations (ID #30288). The agreements were to be officially signed at a tripartite meeting on March 26 by the two governments. They also commissioned a one-year feasibility study beginning in June to determine the types of rehabilitation needed at the meeting. The money provided went toward different projects to facilitate the rehabilitation. In November of 2012, $42 million (from the combined total of grant and loan) went toward 12 separate projects including: updating 42 coach cars, four new locomotives, two diesel shunting locomotives, 30,000 wooden sleepers, track maintenance vehicles, and staff training. A news report indicates that the rest of the money would go to ensuring operations for the train for the next three years.
